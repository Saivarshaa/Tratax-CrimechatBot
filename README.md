## RK62 problem statement - Efficient Chabot Designing for crime registration purpose.

**Description**
## The ChatBot Feature
1 : Provides the environment of chatting based Crime Registration for victims. Victim will be able to register his/her complaint by chatting with chatbot, which gives victim a real time crime registration experience just like in police station.  
2 : It is question & answer based system. The ChatBot asks the questions about the crime incident and the victim has to answer.
3 : Questions of chatbot are always relevant to the crime reported by the user.
4 : Chatbot also accepts the files(pdf, txt, docx) and images for identity or address proof of victim. This System is also useful in collecting any evidence that victim may have.
5 : This Chatbot also has the capability of warning the victim for false complaints. It also explains the consequences and punishments given if anyone is caught filing wrong complaint.   
6 : Chatbot awares victim related to crime that he/she was a victim of.
7 : Chabot questions are User Response oriented means which question is to ask next is decided by user response. So it might happen two person have came to register complaint on same subject  but the question asked to them  are different or we can say question sets are different.
